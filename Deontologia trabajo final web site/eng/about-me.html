            <h1>About me</h1>
            <img src="media/DSCF0509[1] копия.jpg" style="height: 200px" alt="Daria Timofeeva">
            <p>I have finished my bachelor degree in English studies in 2022. My specialization during this time was in lexicology and semantics. In 2021 I have acquired Cambridge Advanced English certificate.</p>
            <h3>Translation and Interpreting</h3>
            <p>In my life I had the opportunity to be a personal interpreter of my mother in many administrative and medical institution. I have been working for her for five years by now interpreting and translating from Spanish to Russian.
            I have also been translating legal documents and texts of laws from Spanish to Russian during the past six years.
            </p>
            <h3>Editting and copywriting</h3>
            <p>Ever since school I have been writing short stories and have published a couple of them online. During my University years I was on an internship in a travelling agency, where I have been creating short descriptions for famous places in Spanish. Recently I have been working for an event organisation agency, where I have been translating publicitary materials and creating new ones in English, Spanish and Russian. I was also creating and mainaining a blog in English, Spanish and Russian.</p>
            <h3>Front-end development</h3>
            <p>Since I am a linguist by degree, I decided to learn some more languages, which are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It opened a whole new world of possibility to me and I am developing my skills in this field right now. I see programming as a method of translation from human languages to the languages of the machines. At the moment, I am continueing working for the event organising agency I have talked about earlier. They have opened to me a great opportunity of trying out programming and I seized it.</p>
